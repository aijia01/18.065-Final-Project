## **18.065 Final-Project: Can we foresee the story ending?**
Exploring deep-learning models to predict how stories will end

🤓Let's take a deep dive into the story and keep looking for a happy ending together!🤩

This repo incldes contents as following:

📒Final report.pdf | The final project report with the analysis& results

🤖Seq2Seq LSTM.mlx | The matlab code script for training a Seq2Seq LSTM with Adam or SGD optimizer

🤖PromptGPT-2.ipynb | A prompt-driven text generation model based on ref[1]

📝 GrimmsPrompt.csv | A spreadsheet for the trained and tested endings for *Grimms' Fairy Tales*

📁 Collection| A repository for results and figures collection

> [1] The GPT-2 original model is [here](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) for reference, it also has a TensorFlow embeded version [here](https://github.com/kamalkraj/minGPT-TF)
